## RHEL 8 Walkthrough
I used Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8. The most up to date version of RHEL is 9 but if you go further into the lab you discover that the most recent that the SCC goes to is RHEL 8 so if I wanted to use RHEL I had to go through the Red Hat website and go through older versions of RHEL. 

From here in order to mount the VM I used VMWare after I noticed that the license on VMWare 17 was still active. AFter congiruing the VM in order to lauch it I had to log into my Red Hat account to link the machine to my account. I was then able to update the machine to a useable state.

From there I logged into my D2L and went into the HW document in order to get to the SCAP page. From there I downloaded it and unzipped it. After using `cd` to get into the proper folder where the executable code was I then started to configure it.

– Enable the one desired benchmark: sudo ./cscc -eb RHEL_8_STIG
