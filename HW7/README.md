## DDL Hiijacking

DDL (Data Definition Language) preload attacks are a type of cyberattack that target a database management system (DBMS) by exploiting vulnerabilities in the database's DDL statements. DDL statements are used to define and manage the structure of a database, including creating, altering, and deleting tables, indexes, and other database objects.
