## Docker Hub Search Results
My first container that I found that looked fun is Monica. Monica is a relationship management system which can either be ran on an Apache webserver or fastCGI-Process webpages. This container is ran by the Monica organization. When running the Monica CRM Docker container, you can specify various environment variables to configure the application. These environment variables allow you to customize the behavior of the Monica CRM container. Here are some common environment variables you can use when running the Monica CRM container:

    DB_CONNECTION: Specifies the database connection type (e.g., mysql, sqlite, postgres).
    DB_HOST: The hostname or IP address of the database server.
    DB_PORT: The port on which the database server is running.
    DB_DATABASE: The name of the database.
    DB_USERNAME: The username to connect to the database.
    DB_PASSWORD: The password to authenticate with the database.

The second container I found was for Composer

## Proof of complete lab
For some reason the ip address of the attacker was not working so I used one within the same subnet
