# Computer and Network Security
This repo will be used for CNS throughout the semester. 

# VMWare
I have decided because I am more comfortable with it that I would be using Ubuntu 22.04 for the semester. This is a Linux system. Because of this I am planning on using VSC.

# How did I install the Vagrant Binary?
I found the binary online through my VM.
