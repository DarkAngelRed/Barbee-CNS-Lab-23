# Computer and Network Security
This repo will be used for CNS throughout the semester. I intend to use VS Code during my Lab sessions due to the fact that I visually like it better and it is easier to multitask with. 

# How did I install the Vagrant Binary?
I used the Windows installer (specifically the top one). My vagrant path is C:\HashiCorp\Vagrant\bin\vagrant.exe. As the program was downloaded it was automatically put there which made it a bit difficult to locate for LAB 1. After this I restarted so Vagrant could finish up.
